# Support Desk

A full-stack support desk application built with **Next.js 16**, **Supabase**, **Redis**, **BullMQ**, and **OpenAI**. Features include authentication, role-based access control, a ticketing system with AI-powered responses, and a real-time chat assistant.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 16, React 19, TailwindCSS 4 |
| Auth & Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Queue | BullMQ + Redis |
| AI | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini |
| Testing | Jest + React Testing Library |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose |

## Features

### Authentication
- Sign up, login, logout with Supabase Auth
- Forgot password + password update flow
- Session-based middleware protection

### Role-Based Access
- `user` — standard permissions, own data only
- `super_admin` — admin dashboard, can view all users and todo counts

### Todo Management
- Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- Completion toggling
- Users can only access their own todos

### Support Tickets
- Submit tickets via a form
- Tickets are queued via BullMQ for async AI processing
- AI auto-response generation with retry logic

### AI Chat
- Real-time chat with OpenAI integration
- Per-user chat history stored in Redis
- Knowledge-base context for app-specific questions

### Analytics
- Ticket stats endpoint (total, resolved, pending, AI success ratio)
